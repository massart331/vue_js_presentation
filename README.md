This part of the SPA application is built on Vue + Vuex.
To set up and start this app, you should do `git clone <link>``, `npm install` and (`npm run server` to start the local server or `npm run build` to build the app in production mode)

The application lets you find and rents cars, but for this presentation we're showing you the part that just lets you search for them. You can filter the search results by brand, model, body type and fuel consumption.
